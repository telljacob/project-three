# Boss Fight Project

The Boss Fight Project was made to explore the possibilities of making my own game from scratch with inspiration from more modern games using only what I have learned through the Python Essentials section of the Full-stack development course at Code Academy.

It's exactly how plain it is what intrigues me. Being able to add the maths and logic of modern games to a simply Python program is an interesting concept to me which I wanted to expand on.

## How to play

The game is easy to understand through the user interface. The user is welcomed, presented with the challange and given the option to go into combat as two different roles (as a tank or a healer).

The tank focuses on damage but occasionally has to choose between healing or dealing damage.

The result of each combat "round" is shown in the terminal together with the players and the bosse's current health pool to make a decision between attacking or healing.

This is what the user is welcomed with when they visit the site:

This is what the terminal looks like mid "combat":

## Challanges

### Scope
- Setting the scope for this project was not easy. I had an initial plan but had to step away from it half-way through. I had initially planned to make three different roles but restricted myself to two because I felt that they were not unique enough. Given more time to expand on my idea I would have liked to introduce situations where the player has to make more advanced decisions. Will probably update in the future.

### Never worked with Heroku
- Heroku is very new to me and it was an eye opener into how useful the site is and to launch applications through it. However, I felt a need to check the outcomes of my code faster than I could.


## Technical difficulties in development
- Workspace was not able to load, contacted support and got sorted eventually after doing a complete reset of the workspace dashboard.
- The site was during parts of the development not able to load properly in Chrome where parts of the page was grey. This bug eventually stopped later down the line of development. Cause unknown.


## Bugs
- Early on in development "None" would show up in the input field. Eventually I figured out that print is not necessary to have together with input.


## Deployment
The site was deployed through Code Institute's mock terminal in Heroku:
- Copy repository
- Create new app on Heroku
- Set the buildbacks to Python and NodeJS
- Link the Heroku app to github repository on the Heroku site (double check repo settings)
- click on Deploy


## Credit
I have nothing to credit, the code is my own.
